- 👋 Hi, I’m @mstaylor529
- 👀 I’m interested in programing, audio/video, wiring/electricity,cars, pentesting, ethical hacking, and most of all i like learning new things about all the linux distros because i taught myself how to use linux from scratch. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about pentesting, partitions, and dual booting from a chromebook.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything for begginers!
